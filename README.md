# DevMatch

DevMatch is a fictional startup website where entrepreneurs can meet developers to work and collaborate together on projects.
This is my very first Ruby on Rails application, which I created by taking a course at [Upskill courses](http://upskillcourses.com/).
This project is intended for demonstrational and learning purposes, to discover various aspects and capabilities of the Rails framework.
